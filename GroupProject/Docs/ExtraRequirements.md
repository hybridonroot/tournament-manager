# Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are those used to describe the system as a whole and not specific behaviors, i.e., the quality requirements.

**Author**: Team 50

The system has the following non-functional requirements:

**Performance** - the system is expected to respond within a reasonable (defined as sub-second) time. As it is run on a single device, throughput and utilization measures are not applicable.

**Network** - the application is self-contained on a single device; no internet is required once the application is installed.

**Scalability** - single device, single instance running at a time.

**Availability** - fully contained on device; no client/server requirement.

**Usability** - intuitive interface that a user can understand and use without training.

**Maintainability** - the code will be documented  to expedite bug fixes and and available on github to maintain a log of issues.

**Recoverability** - the data is to be saved on the device and available between application runs.

**Documentation** - a documentation file containing screenshots is to be provided with the app and available on github.
