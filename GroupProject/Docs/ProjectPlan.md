## 2 Process Description

**Requirements engineering** is a process of identifying quantifiable, relevant, and detailed requirements for a project.
*Entrance criteria* include existing system design, stakeholder needs, organizational standards, and domain/industry knowledge.
*Exit criteria* include mutually (by all stakeholders, including developers) agreed requirements (both functional and non-functional), system requirements, and a model of the system.

**Design** is a rough model of software structure that is gradually becoming more complete as the project advances.
*Entrance criteria* are the requirements defined in Requirements Engineering phase.
*Exit criteria* include logical and software design, including front end (user application) and back end (database, web server, etc.

**Implementation** is the development of code that implements the design specified in the previous phase.
Entrance criteria include design artifacts produced in the previous step. 
Exit criteria include actual code implementing the design, including front end and back end systems.
**Verification and Validation** is the process testing to ensure that the application behaves in accordance with gathered requirements and specified design.
*Entrance criteria* include software code developed in the Implementation phase.
*Exit criteria* include error-free testing results, to ensure the software behaves as intended.
**Maintenance** is the bug fixes and operating system updates phase of the life cycle.
*Entrance criteria* include the final software as tested in the previous phase.
